After the 24 hours is up, you’ll be able to present your project to a judge and compete for prizes. Along the way, you’ll also have opportunities to learn more about the industry and have fun with your fellow hackers!',

We’ve got live workshops where you can learn brand new skills, and our mentors will be happy to help you bring your ideas to reality. Also, hackathons aren’t all about coding; robotics, hardware, business, and design skills are also very valuable! So if you’re not interested in coding, you can find a team and be in charge of business or design instead!',
