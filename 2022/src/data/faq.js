    question: 'What is a hackathon?',
    answer:
      'A hackathon is an event where aspiring programmers, graphic designers, and entrepreneurs gather to create a tech-based project that solves a problem of your choosing! After the allocated “hacking time” is up, you’ll be able to present your project to judges to compete for prizes. Along the way, you’ll also have opportunities to learn more about cool computer science topics and the tech industry, as well as participate in fun activities with fellow hackers!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who can participate?',
    answer:
      'We welcome all high school students and motivated middle school students to sign up for JAMHacks! We want you to gain something from JAMHacks regardless of your skill level, location, or background. If you do not fit within our target age range for hackers, we encourage you to participate as a mentor or as a judge.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will JAMHacks be running in-person or online?',
    answer:
      'This year, JAMHacks will be adopting a hybrid event model! We will be running both in-person and online events. In-person events will be held at the University of Waterloo, and online events will be held through our Discord server. We will be posting more information about the details soon!',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I don’t know how to code?',
    answer:
      'That’s okay! At JAMHacks, learning is just as important as building and creating. We’ve got live workshops where you can learn brand new skills, and our mentors will be happy to help you bring your ideas to reality. Also, hackathons aren’t all about coding; robotics, hardware, business, and design skills are also very valuable! So if you’re not interested in coding, you can find a team and be in charge of business or design instead!',
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of workshops, talks, and activities will there be?',
    answer:
      'Our events are designed to fit everyone’s needs, so there will be everything from programming, to hardware, even to business and marketing. We know how to have fun, too—expect tons of games and contests!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I have to submit a project?',
    answer:
      'We highly recommend that you submit a project to get a feel for the pitching process—after all, it’s part of the hackathon experience. Our judging criteria places more emphasis on creativity than technical complexity, and even some winning projects in the past have had plenty of bugs and unimplemented features. However, please note that project submission is certainly not mandatory, as we value learning much more than the result.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How big can my team be?',
    answer: 'Teams of up to four are allowed to participate in the event.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How will we communicate during the event?',
    answer:
      'We will mainly be using Discord to communicate hackathon-wide announcements and conduct judging, and you are welcome to use the server to connect with mentors and other hackers. YouTube will be used to broadcast our opening and closing ceremonies. Finally, be sure to follow us on social media for updates leading up to and throughout the event!',
  },
  {
    question: 'If I am under 18, can I attend in-person?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely! you just need your parent/guardian to sign a waiver for you and attach it to our Hacker Registration Information Form.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'If I choose to attend in-person, do I need to stay there the entire time, including at night?',
    answer:
      'Yes. For liability reasons, in-person hackers must remain on our venue for the entirety of the event. Requests to leave the venue will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis during the event.',

    question: 'Is food provided for in-person hackers?',
    answer:
      'Yes, thanks to our sponsors, we will be providing our in-person participants food throughout the weekend for free!',

  {
    question: 'What do I need to bring with me if I am attending in-person?',
    answer:
      'Devices, chargers, and whatever other accessories (e.g. hardware) that you think you should have for your project. Oh, and don’t forget blankets or a sleeping bag if you plan to get some quality sleep!',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do we get to the venue?',
    answer:
      'Unfortunately, JAMHacks 6 will not be providing participants travel accommodations/reimbursements this year. Please arrange your own transportation or carpool with other hackers if you live around KW region and plan to attend in-person.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'Some of my teammates are attending in-person but others are attending virtually, is that fine?',
    answer:
      "Yes! There will be Internet access for you to communicate with your team members, so you're welcome to form a mixed team.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does judging work?',
    answer:
      "If you are attending in-person, you will pitch your project in front of a panel of judges; if you're attending virtually, you will still pitch your project live to judges via a Discord call. Regardless of your method of participation, your team is also expected to create a pitch video as part of your Devpost submission.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What can my project be about?',
    answer:
      'Your project can be about anything you can dream of—as long as it involves technology in some manner.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there people to help me?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely! We have university students and industry professionals as mentors to answer your technical questions, and you can always reach out to an organizer with event-related questions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is the event 36 hours long this year',
    answer:
      'As a beginner-oriented hackathon, we have increased the “hacking time” from 24 hours to 36 hours to give everyone plenty of time to adjust: that means more buffer time between workshops, more fun activities for you to take part in as a break from your project, and more time for you to sleep if you’d like.',

    question: 'Have a question that isn’t listed here?',
    answer:
      'Feel free to email us at hello@jamhacks.ca or send us a direct message on Instagram @jamhacks.',
